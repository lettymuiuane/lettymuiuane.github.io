    <h3>Hey there! Welcome to my personal website. </h3>
    <p>My name is Leticia Muiuane and I am a Senior studying Management Information Systems with an Accelerated Masters in Management Information Technology. This past summer, I had the opportunity to work as a Customer Success Account Manager(CSAM) for Microsoft.</p>
    <p>The internship, even though virtual, was extremely beneficial to my professional growth. I worked alongisde Customer engineers, Incident Managers, and other CSAM's to close overdue cases.</p>
    <p>This website will serve as a digital resume for future employers. It includes different pages with information about myself, my skills, projects I've completed, and contact information.</p>
